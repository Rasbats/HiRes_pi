# HiRes_pi

This is a simple utility for adding files from GshhsHiRes.zip to the OpenCPN program. These files produce a better resolution of the 
base map coastline than those provided by the initial installation.

The utility uses a hard-coded URL "http://opencpn.org/ocpn/downloads/data/GshhsHiRes.zip". If this changes the code will need to be
updated.

WINDOWS ... The utility can be installed from the .exe in the Releases section here. If using the dll please remove .pdf and copy to
the plugins folder.

Not yet tested with Linux.
